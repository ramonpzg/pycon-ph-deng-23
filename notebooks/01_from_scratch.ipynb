    "There are different kinds of data pipelines, but two, in particular, dominate a big part of the data engineering world today, ETL and ELT pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are ETL Pipelines?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The acronym ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load, and it is the process where data gets extracted from one or multiple sources, it gets processed in-transit, and then it gets loaded into place where data consumers can use (e.g. a data warehouse). These consumers can be data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers, among many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are ELT Pipelines?**\n",
    "With this approach, all the data, structured and unstructured, gets loaded into a data lake or warehouse before it gets transformed. With this approach, a lot of money spent on compute can be saved by only processing the data we need rather than all of it.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "**What are Reverse ETL Pipelines?**\n",
    "Reverse ETL tools take data from the data lake or warehouse back into business (critical) applications. For example, information about new customers that have not yet been populated into salesforce or other marketing tools for further use by the marketing, sales, and finance teams, and so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why should you learn how to create them?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Pipeline tools enable data integration strategies by allowing companies to gather data from multiple data sources and consolidate it into a single, centralized location. ETL tools also make it possible for different types of data to work together, for example, data generated by the company can be combined with GPS and Temperature data coming from different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "As data professionals, our task is to create value for our organizations, our clients and our collaborators using some of or all the data at our disposal. However, there are factors that can delay this process a little bit or a lot, for example, we often need to understand beforehand,\n",
    "1. Information about the process by which the data we're dealing with was generated, e.g.\n",
    "    - Point of sale\n",
    "    - Clicks on an online marketplace like Amazon, Etzy, Ebay, ect.\n",
    "    - A/B Test Results\n",
    "    - ...\n",
    "2. Information about the transformations that occurred during the cleaning and merging process, prior to us jumping on board,\n",
    "    - Celsius degrees were converted into fahrenheit\n",
    "    - Prices in Chilean pesos were converted to Rands\n",
    "    - Non-numerical and unavailable observations now contain \"Not Available\" or \"Unknown\"\n",
    "    - ...\n",
    "3. Information about how the data was stored and where. For instance,\n",
    "    - Parquet format\n",
    "    - NOSQL or SQL database\n",
    "    - CSV\n",
    "    - ...\n",
